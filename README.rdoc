= Inkwell
=======

Inkwell - gives ability to add social networking features to your rails application â€“ comments, reblogs, favorites, following/followers, timelines.

== Requirements
You should have two classes: User and Post or other identical. Between them should be a one-to-many relationship. For example:

  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :posts
  end

  class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :user
  end

== Installation

Put in <code>Gemfile</code>:

  gem 'inkwell', :git => 'git://github.com/salkar/inkwell.git'

Add to your <code>User</code> model <code>acts_as_inkwell_user</code> and to your <code>Post</code> model <code>acts_as_inkwell_post</code>

  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :posts
    acts_as_inkwell_user
  end
  
  class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :user
    acts_as_inkwell_post
  end

Create <code>inkwell.rb</code> file in <code>config/initializers</code> and put in it your names of <code>User</code> and <code>Post</code> tables (or other identical):

  module Inkwell
    class Engine < Rails::Engine
      config.post_table = :posts
      config.user_table = :users
    end
  end

Next, get gem migrations:

  rake inkwell:install:migrations

and <code>db:migrate</code> it.
